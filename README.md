# ShooterGame LTS

## Introduction

ShooterGame LTS (Long-term support) is a port of ShooterGame Unreal Engine 5 with the goal to modernize, fix and generally maintain the now defunct & adandoned ShooterGame. Support starts at Unreal Engine Version 5.1.

If you're like me, Lyra felt a little bit overwhelming and over-engineered and more of a showcase than an appropriate replacement for ShooterGame. This project was made for you. The source code may look a little different as it has been reorganized. Here's a quick sum up of the notable features i've changed so far:

| Feature                   | Status |
| -------------             | ------------- |
| Console Support           | Removed       |
| Loading Screen Module     | Removed       |
| Slate / Canvas UI         | Removed       |
| CompanionApp / WebServer  | Removed       |
| Nvidia Reflex             | Removed       |
| IWYU & Build Settings V2  | Added         |
| Enhanced Input            | Added         |
| Asset Manager             | Added         |
